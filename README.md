I successfully completed my first project using Scrapy, a web crawling and data extraction framework. I was able to extract specific information from multiple websites and store it in a structured format in a database. This project allowed me to learn the basics of Scrapy, including its architecture, selectors, pipelines, and middlewares. I also gained experience in managing and executing spiders, handling responses, and dealing with obstacles such as website blocking and captcha verification. Overall, this project provided a solid foundation for my future web scraping endeavors.
